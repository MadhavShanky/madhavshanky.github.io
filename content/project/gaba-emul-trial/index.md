Gabapentin is a form of anti-seizure medication (ASM). These ASM drugs are administered to older adults after acute ischemic strokes (AIS), to help with post-stroke care. However, in standard practice, there are many unknown risks of initiation with Gabapentin, which might lead to higher rates of readmission due to related comorbidities. No trials have been conducted to determine if Gabapentin use affects readmission rates in the elderly. We look to use tools from literature on semi-competing risks and emulated trial designs to conduct an analysis on the Medicare dataset, linked with insurance registry claims.
