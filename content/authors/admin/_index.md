I am a 4th year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Biostatistics, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/), advised by [Rajarshi Mukherjee](https://scholar.harvard.edu/rajarshi/home). My research interests are primarily in the application of high dimensional statistics and random matrix theory to problems in statistical genetics. Prior to joining Harvard, I completed my B.Stat (Hons.) and M.Stat from [Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in/). 

Currently, I am also working as a research assistant at the [Centre for Value-based Health Care and Sciences](https://www.massgeneral.org/neurology/research/value-based-population-health) at [Mass General Brigham](https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en), working on projects related to emulated trial designs on the Medicare dataset. This research assistantship is co-advised by [Sebastien Haneuse](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/sebastien-haneuse/) and [Lidia Moura](https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/19690/lidia-maria-moura).

In my spare time, I enjoy solving and [designing puzzles](https://madmahoganypuzzles.wordpress.com/), playing badminton and table tennis, dancing, participating and [conducting quizzes](https://www.slideshare.net/MadhavSankaranarayan/), and designing origami.
