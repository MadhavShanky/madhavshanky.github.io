abstract: We investigate the problem of minimax optimal detection of the number of spikes in lower rank signal plus large Wigner models. In this regard, we categorize sharp conditions for asymptotic power in testing for the number of spikes being k0 versus k1 in terms of k1; k0 and the spectral gap between the first k0 and last k1 - k0 spiked eigenvalues. Additionally, when spikes are bounded, we elucidate a novel optimal test in the subcritical regime under a Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble. For the general hypothesis testing problem, we compare the performance of some ubiquitous tests in spike detection problems. We also elucidate an algorithm for estimating the number of spikes in outlying spiked setups.
