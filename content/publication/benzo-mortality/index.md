abstract: Despite guideline warnings and concerns for increased mortality, acute ischemic stroke (AIS) survivors older than 66 years of age still receive benzodiazepines (BZDs). We examined the BZD-associated effect on mortality within 30 days post-discharge on survival among older Medicare beneficiaries after an AIS. We analyzed a sample of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled for at least 12 months before hospitalization for AIS. Our primary exposure was BZD initiation within 30 days post-discharge, and its primary outcome was 90 days mortality risk differences (RDs) from discharge using trial emulation with methods to address confounding (i.e., cloning, weighting, censoring, and inverse-probability-of-censoring weighting). Of 47 421 beneficiaries, 826 (1.74%) initiated BZD 30 days post-discharge, and 6392 (13.48%) died within 90 days. The median age was 79 (IQR of 12), with 55.3% female, 82.9% White, 10.1% Black, 1.7% Hispanic, 2.2% Asian, and 0.4% American Native. After standardization (based on age, sex, race/ethnicity, length of stay, and baseline dementia), the 90-day mortality risk revealed an RD of 26 events per 1000 (95% CI is 22, 33). Subgroup analyses revealed higher RDs in older age groups, particularly those aged 86 or older, with an RD of 84 events per 1000 (95% CI is 73, 106), and for patients with baseline dementia, with an RD of 87 events per 1000 (95% CI is 63, 112). Initiating BZDs within 30 days post-AIS discharge was associated with increased 90 days mortality risk, especially in older adults 76 years and older and those with baseline dementia, highlighting their vulnerability to BZD adverse effects.

#summary: Older adults receive benzodiazepines for agitation, anxiety, and insomnia after acute ischemic stroke (AIS). No trials have been conducted to determine if benzodiazepine use affects poststroke mortality in the elderly. Recent work has concluded that there is no short-term mortality from benzodiazepine use post-acute ischemic stroke in a local cohort of patients. We look to extend the analysis of mortality and other important outcomes to the Medicare dataset, linked with insurance registry claims. We employ methodology from emulated trials literature to construct sophisticated models that account for semi-competing risks and overlapping observation times.
